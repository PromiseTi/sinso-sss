SINSO is a decentralized medical + NFT infrastructure architecture based on filecoin ecology. The "project of medical image data aggregator for telemedicine and AI diagnosis" submitted by SINSO during the filecoin acceleration camp has become the world's top 11 among more than 200 projects around the world and obtained the official grant of filecoin. First of all, SINSO wants to build a series of components in the soil of Web 3.0 to realize the vision of "mankind entering the era of democratic medical care".
