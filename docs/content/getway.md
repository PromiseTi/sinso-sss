Provide data acquisition standard API interface, data preprocessing and privacy calculation module, and exchange data with individuals and institutions through standard API. SINSO Getway will encourage effective data upload in the filecoin ecology, and the SINSO team will also provide more applied LDN (large datacap) resources and miners' shared resources to accelerate the implementation of effective data mining applications.

In order to improve the efficiency of SINSO Getway, we also provide a distributed hot data cache layer and build hot data mining, so that people don't need to build unsafe nearby IPFs full nodes when building DAPP.

Based on SINSO Getway, we can build professional distributed storage applications. SINSO recently released an application developed based on SINSO Getway components: DicomNetwork. Learned more(youtube 视频链接）
This is the first open source medical project based on Filecoin, a storage network and diagnosis platform for doctors and patients around the world. DicomNetwork works based on Filecoin's web3.storage, which is very popular It is easy to build web applications and provides users with free access to filecoin network, data storage and data retrieval opportunities. Dicomnetwork is a great case based on web3.storage. SINSO dicomnetwork does the most valuable thing according to the concept of large-scale online medical release of MOOM(massive open online medicine).
